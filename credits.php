animation for 14 video games.</p>
				<p id="collapse-andy" style="display:none">I've also worked on a small number of short films in Canada as well as two feature length films in the area of visual effects and graphical displays. Blink however is the first proper chance to shoot one story start to finish. It was a challenge. I'm also an illustrator and clay sculptor but I need to setup a studio here to further refine my portfolio.</p>

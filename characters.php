				<h2>Jon</h2>
				<h4>Played by Jon Amar</h4>
				<p>You know how it goes... "just another expat artist living in Berlin." He's a giant comic book addict. Hence his superhero-inspired underwear line, which sells in a few local Berlin shops. The line is starting to gain some ground. Despite that, he knows they're silly. That's part of what he likes about the business.</p>
				<p>Jon moved from Vancouver, Canada to Berlin a year ago with his girlfriend Kat. They needed the change of pace and both wanted to give their artistic careers an honest chance. He really likes Berlin. Lots of good walks for him and his dog and lots of underwear buying hipsters to keep him afloat. Still, sometimes not being able to speak German can leave him feeling rather alone and adrift.</p>

				<h2>Annie</h2>
				<h4>Played by Vanessa Locke</h4>
				<p>The perennial loner wolf, not by choice but, by necessity. Annie's power is isolating and has left her with few friends over the years. She manages to put her trademark bright smile on things with that stubborn optimism of her's. But her ability to draw on the life force of others is a dangerous power to wield both for her self and those around her...</p>

				<h2>Kat</h2>
				<h4>Played by Christine Utterberg</h4>
				<p>Kat is a photographer finally making a name for herself in Berlin. She originally comes from Seattle where she grew up learning all about photography and the good old days from her grandfather. She still is pretty nostalgic for old cameras and the good old days and so Berlin fits perfectly into her life right now. And she also has Jon, her boyfriend/anchor whom she met some years ago in Vancouver. However, the more things start to change for her and Jon, the more she realizes that Jon may no longer be the reliable anchor that she always could count on.</p>

				<h2>The Crow</h2>
				<h4>Played by David Masterson</h4>
				<p>The Crow is a mysterious and stoic person. In fact, this is what attracted Annie to him in the first place. The two share a deep bond built on the kind of trust that comes from going through dark times with someone and making your way back out together. Yet despite their closeness, their relationship is not a romantic one. The Crow is deeply protective of Annie and spends what ever time he can spare watching over Annie and supporting her... lifestyle.</p>
